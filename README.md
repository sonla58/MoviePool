## MoviePool

A small application to search for movies via OMDB API.
This is a small project to learn more about SwiftUI and Combine.
Architecture is also a big part of this project (in the future =))).

## Structure

### MVVM

This project uses the new approach for building MVVM architecture in SwiftUI.
The main idea is to use a `View` acting as a `ViewModel` and another `View` acting as a `View`.

‚ùì Why?

Updating... I will write about it soon. ü•±

## Todo

- [ ] OMDB service should be communicating with the application layer in Respository pattern
- [ ] Injections should be done via Dependency Injection
- [ ] Optimize the loading of the images in the list of results
- [ ] Support multiple platforms (macOS, tvOS)
